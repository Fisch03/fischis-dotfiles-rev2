# fischis-dotfiles-rev2
My (new) dotfiles for awesomewm

### Some info
- Multi-Monitor support
- Organized files, allowing you to easily change stuff
- Do not only look good, but are also made to not disturb your workflow (trust me, i use these everyday)

### Installation
- Install [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) (I am using awesomewm-git but you may also have success with the normal one)
- Install [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) (again, i am using picom-git but you cant try the normal one)
- Clone this repository (`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fisch03/fischis-dotfiles-rev2`)
- Navigate into it (`cd fischis-dotfiles-rev2`)
- Copy the config files to your awesome config directory (`cp -r config/awesome ~/.config/awesome`) <br>
  **Make sure to back up any existing configs beforehand!**
- Reload awesome (The default shortcut should be mod + ctrl + r)
- Done!
